# IDS706 DataEngineering

_Week 3: Polars Descriptive Statistics Script_

### üéØ Objective: 
This project is part of the assignment for week 3 of the course. The main objective of this task is to create a Python script that uses the Polars library to perform descriptive statistics on a dataset, generate a summary of statistics, and create data visualization that summarize the information.


### üîç Dataset: 
For this asigment, we will use the [LinkedIn Tech Jobs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/linkedin-jobs?resource=download&select=final_data.csv) 

The "LinkedIn Jobs Dataset" is a comprehensive collection of job listings and related information sourced from LinkedIn, one of the world's leading professional networking platforms. This dataset provides valuable insights into job opportunities, job market trends, and various attributes associated with job listings.

### üß™ Methodology

In this project, the [LinkedInTechJobsDataset.csv](LinkedInTechJobsDataset.csv)  was analyzed using a Python script [main.py](https://github.com/nogibjj/IDS706_DataEngineering_BarbaraFlores_Miniproject3/blob/main/main.py) file, which generates the outputs presented in **this Markdown file**

### üìä Results
If we calculate some descriptive statistics, we obtain the following:

### üë• Histogram of total number of applicants per job posting

![Total_applicants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nogibjj/IDS706_DataEngineering_BarbaraFlores_Miniproject3/main/total_applicants.png)

From the histogram, it is evident that the majority of job postings have more than 500 applicants. This underscores the importance of having a professional profile that can stand out among other applicants.
