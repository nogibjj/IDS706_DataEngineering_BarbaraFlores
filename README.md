_Week 2: Pandas Descriptive Statistics Script_

### üéØ Objective: 
This project is part of the assignment for week 2 of the course. The main objective of this task is to create a Python script that uses the Pandas library to perform descriptive statistics on a dataset, generate a summary of statistics, and create data visualization that summarize the information.


### üîç Dataset: 
For this asigment, we will use the [LinkedIn Tech Jobs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/linkedin-jobs?resource=download&select=final_data.csv) 

The "LinkedIn Jobs Dataset" is a comprehensive collection of job listings and related information sourced from LinkedIn, one of the world's leading professional networking platforms. This dataset provides valuable insights into job opportunities, job market trends, and various attributes associated with job listings.

### üß™ Methodology

In this project, the [LinkedInTechJobsDataset.csv](LinkedInTechJobsDataset.csv)  was analyzed using two different methodologies were used with the aim of testing and understanding both possible procedures.

1. In a Jupyter file [LinkedInTechJobs.ipynb](https://github.com/nogibjj/IDS706_DataEngineering_BarbaraFlores/blob/main/LinkedInTechJobs.ipynb) where it is possible to easily visualize the outputs and the code used.

2. In a Python script [main.py](https://github.com/nogibjj/IDS706_DataEngineering_BarbaraFlores/blob/main/main.py) file, which generates the results presented in **this Markdown file**
